# AESH
Accessibility Enhanced by Sound and Haptics. Human-Computer Interaction MS research project.

Andrew Littleton and Jack O'Hare

## Abstract
	The Accessibility Enhanced by Sound and Haptics (AESH) project is designed to analyze and refactor accessibility features within home gaming consoles using enhanced audio and haptic feedback to benefit those requiring the features. Initial tests gauged reactions and ease of use of the accessibility narrator by the test subject within the three major game consoles; PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. 
	Research for haptic and audio response development continued with the Xbox One and was based on the ideas of psychological conditioning intended to invoke unconscious or semi-conscious responses to stimuli from the console. Audio development was based on core sound design techniques and audience response understanding. This relied on the idea of “bright” affirmative sounds and “dark” negative sounds. Haptic feedback research was based on video game control schemes and discussion about how users effectively interact with the controller to perform actions as well as receive feedback. 	Enhancements and modifications were considered beneficial and audio considered beneficial but unnecessary. Each feature is important but would be beneficial to add for accessibility features on operating systems as they will give users that need it an extra level of customization and eliminate some feelings of discouragement related to the stigma of using accessibility-based features.
